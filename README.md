# CBN-No-Addictions
A simple mod designed to remove the chances for addiction to all default comestibles in Cataclysm: Bright Nights.

Simply download the folder into your Cataclysm:BN mods folder. To delete, simply remove. To disable, set the 'obsolete' flag in modinfo.json to true.

Keep in mind that mutagens have a base addiction rate - so if you have other mods that change mutagens it may override the addiction potential.
